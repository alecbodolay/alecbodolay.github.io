## About me

I am a graduate student in the [Neuroimaging and Informatics](https://niin.usc.edu/about#program) Master's Program at the University of Southern California (USC). My research interest involves applying data science and machine learning to optimize image analysis, particularly MRI brain data.

## Background

-   **Neuroscience:** Clinical Research;
-   **Data Science:** Visualization, processing, and machine learning;
-   **Data engineering:** Data pipeline implementation and optimization;
-   **Image analysis:** MRI brain data with FSL and SPM

I began building my foundation in data science through my role as a programmer at the [Center for Addicition Medicine](https://www.mghaddictionmedicine.com) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) from 2022 through 2024, under the supervision of Randi M. Shuster, PhD and Anne Eden Evins, MD, MPH, and co-authoring [4 papers](/publications.qmd) on adolescent substance use.
