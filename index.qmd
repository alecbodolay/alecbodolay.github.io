## About me

I am a graduate student in the [Neuroimaging and Informatics](https://niin.usc.edu/about#program) Master's Program at the University of Southern California (USC). My research interests involve applying data science and machine learning to process biomedical signals, with a focus in magnetic resonance images of the brain.

## Background

-   **Image Analysis:** MRI brain data using FSL and SPM;
-   **Data Engineering:** Pipeline implementation and optimization;
-   **Data Science:** Visualization, processing, and machine learning;
-   **Clinical Trials:** Statistical analysis, Good Clinical Practice (GCP);
-   **Neuroscience:** Graduate and undergrduate studies.

I began building my foundation in data science through my role as a programmer at the [Center for Addiction Medicine](https://www.mghaddictionmedicine.com) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) from 2022 through 2024, under the supervision of Randi M. Shuster, PhD and Anne Eden Evins, MD, MPH, and co-authoring [4 papers](/publications.qmd) on adolescent substance use.
